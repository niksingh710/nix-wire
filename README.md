**nix-wire** is a lightweight utility for structuring and wiring Nix flakes.
It automatically discovers and assembles configurations for:

* **NixOS hosts** (`hosts/nixos/â€¦`)
* **Darwin hosts** (`hosts/darwin/â€¦`)
* **Home Manager users** (`hosts/home/â€¦`)
* **Packages** (`packages/â€¦`)
* **DevShells** (`devshells/â€¦`)

Instead of manually importing every `.nix` file, nix-wire walks your project directories and generates the right attributes for your `flake.nix`.

## Example directory structure

```text
.
â”œâ”€â”€ hosts
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ home
â”‚   â”‚   â””â”€â”€ alice.nix
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ nixos
â”‚   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ workstation
â”‚   â”‚   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ users
â”‚   â”‚   â”‚   â”‚   â””â”€â”€ bob.nix
â”‚   â”‚   â”‚   â””â”€â”€ default.nix
â”‚   â”‚   â””â”€â”€ laptop.nix
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ darwin
â”‚       â”œâ”€â”€ macbook
â”‚       â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ users
â”‚       â”‚   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ carol
â”‚       â”‚   â”‚   â”‚   â””â”€â”€ default.nix
â”‚       â”‚   â”‚   â””â”€â”€ dave.nix
â”‚       â”‚   â””â”€â”€ default.nix
â”‚       â””â”€â”€ office-mac.nix
â”œâ”€â”€ devshells
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ default.nix
â”œâ”€â”€ packages
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ foo
â”‚   â”‚   â””â”€â”€ default.nix
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ bar.nix
â”œâ”€â”€ flake.lock
â””â”€â”€ flake.nix
```

### Notes

* `hosts/nixos/<hostname>/default.nix` â†’ NixOS configuration for that host
* `hosts/darwin/<hostname>/default.nix` â†’ Darwin configuration for that host
* `hosts/home/<username>.nix` â†’ Home Manager configuration for a standalone user
* `hosts/nixos/<hostname>/users/<username>.nix` â†’ attach users to a specific host
* `packages/<name>.nix` or `packages/<name>/default.nix` â†’ reusable packages
* `devshells/default.nix` â†’ development shells

ðŸ‘‰ All these directories (`hosts`, `packages`, `devshells`) are **optional**.
Your `mkFlake` setup decides which ones to opt into.

## Acknowledgements

We're aware of similar projects like [blueprint](https://github.com/numtide/blueprint) and many others in the Nix ecosystem. **nix-wire** intentionally keeps things bare minimum to focus solely on wiring flake configurations without additional complexity.

This project is currently in a pre-baked state. Proper acknowledgements, documentation, and feature comparisons will be added as the project matures.

## TODOs

* [ ] Better template / test structure
* [ ] Add CI with checks (formatting, evaluation, etc.)
* [ ] Integrate `nix flake check` *(recommended, ensures configs evaluate properly; may require minimal test modules)*
* [ ] GitBook docs
